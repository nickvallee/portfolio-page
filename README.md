##My Udacity Portfolio Page

This is the github for my portfolio page. At the moment it consists of mostly HTML and CSS, but is powered by a number of NPM packages to organize the files, and optimize it for all viewports.

If you have any suggestions, please do not hesistate to let me know. I am still in the process of learning all of this, so all help is welcome.
